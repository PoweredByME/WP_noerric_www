        "Cricket, which is perhaps the second widely played sport around the world has an audience of 2.5 billion which is fully engaged in it. The game revolves aroung 22 people and a single ball that has significance during every single match. And while it is critical to be precise in the evaluations of players, there are some occasions of uncertainty.",
        "Like back in 2016, during a match between India and England, the English batsman Joe Root was given an out on a no-ball, leading to England's defeat. And the concerning thing was that it wasn't identified by the umpires either. ",
        "Now this is where Noerric plays its part. It features its \"smart-wicket\" system through a blend of Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning (powered by IBM WATSON). These special wickets can not only identify foot no-ball but also other factors like a run-out or a stump-out. The wickets opertate the moment the bowler releases the ball till when the ball recahes the bat. The wickets are tied with a smart wrist band that the umpire would wear. If there is a no-ball, it will be clearly indicated on the band.",
        "The fascinating part is that this state-of-the-art technology has a myriad of applications such as in American Soccer, hockey and football."
